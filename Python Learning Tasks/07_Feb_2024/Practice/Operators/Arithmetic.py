Floor division explanation: 
Mathematical division that rounds down to nearest integer. The floor division operator is //. 
For example, the expression 11 // 4 evaluates to 2 in contrast to the 2.75 returned by float true division. 
Note that (-11) // 4 is -3 because that is -2.75 rounded downward.
